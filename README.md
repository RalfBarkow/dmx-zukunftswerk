# DMX Zukunftswerk

Zukunftswerk is a platform for bilingual collaboration. It provides shared workspaces for handling and commenting
on various kinds of content objects (documents, notes, textblocks). Content objects are freely placed on a workspace "canvas", and can be decorated by headings and arrows. Every user input is automatically translated on-the-fly by the means of the
[DeepL](https://www.deepl.com) service.

The canvas is synchronized between collaborating users. There are 3 user roles: *administrators* (create workspaces and user accounts, manage menberships), *editors* (edit content objects and arrange the canvas), and *users* (browsing canvas content).

The Zukunftswerk application is developed by contract with the
[Deutsch-FranzÃ¶sisches Zukunftswerk](https://df-zukunftswerk.eu).
The Zukunftswerk UI is fixed to German/French languages. A generalized version of this application, with configurable
languages, is available as project "[Linqa](https://github.com/dmx-systems/dmx-linqa)".

Zukunftswerk is an application for the [DMX platform](https://github.com/dmx-systems/dmx-platform). Both, Zukunftswerk and Linqa are Open Source software.
